## Quick Start

### Installation via Helm
To begin the installation, use Helm to deploy 2A from the specified OCI registry:
```bash
helm install hmc oci://ghcr.io/mirantis/hmc/charts/hmc --version 0.0.4 -n hmc-system --create-namespace
```
> If you want to adjust the configuration, please check the [installation guide](../usage/installation.md).

### Verification

The installation process takes a few minutes to fully complete, as 2A and its subcomponents are installed and configured.

To verify that all components are up and running, check the status of the pods within the `hmc-system` namespace. Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n hmc-system
```

The output is similar to:

```bash
NAME                                                           READY   STATUS

```

If you have fewer pods, give 2A more time to reconcile all the pods.

As a second verification, check that the example `ClusterTemplate` objects have been installed and are valid:

```bash
kubectl get clustertemplate -n hmc-system
```

The output is similar to:

```bash
NAME                                VALID
aws-eks-0-0-2                       true
aws-hosted-cp-0-0-3                 true
aws-standalone-cp-0-0-3             true
azure-hosted-cp-0-0-3               true
azure-standalone-cp-0-0-3           true
vsphere-hosted-cp-0-0-3             true
vsphere-standalone-cp-0-0-3         true
```
